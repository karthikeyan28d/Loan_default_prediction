●	For Banks:

It is always an interesting and challenging problem to predict how likely a client is going to default the loan when they only have a handful of information. In the modern era, the data science teams in the banks build predictive models using machine learning. The datasets used by them are most likely to be proprietary and are usually collected internally through their daily businesses. In other words, there are not many real-world datasets that we can use if we want to work on such financial projects.

●	Credit risk assessment:

It is crucial to the success of lending institutions since customer credit risk affects profitability directly. Traditional procedures are inefficient and time-consuming. The goal of our project is to investigate the use of machine learning approaches in loan prediction that is more dynamic and adaptable to changing client data. These techniques will also provide higher accuracy in predicting loan default.

●	The two most pressing issues in the banking sector are:

1.) How risky is the borrower? 2.) Should we lend to the borrower given the risk? The response to the first question dictates the borrower's interest rate. Interest rate, among other things (such as time value of money), tests the riskiness of the borrower, i.e. the higher the interest rate, the riskier the borrower. We will then decide whether the applicant is suitable for the loan based on the interest rate. Lenders (investors) make loans to creditors in return for the guarantee of interest-bearing repayment. That is, the lender only makes a return (interest) if the borrower repays the loan. However, whether he or she does not repay the loan, the lender loses money. Banks make loans to customers in exchange for the guarantee of repayment. Some would default on their debts, unable to repay them for a number of reasons. The bank retains insurance to minimize the possibility of failure in the case of a default. The insured sum can cover the whole loan amount or just a portion of it. Banking processes use manual procedures to determine whether or not a borrower is suitable for a loan based on results. Manual procedures were mostly effective, but they were insufficient when there were a large number of loan applications. At that time, making a decision would take a long time. As a result, the loan prediction machine learning model can be used to assess a customer's loan status and build strategies. This model extracts and introduces the essential features of a borrower that influence the customer's loan status. Finally, it produces the planned performance (loan status). These reports make a bank manager's job simpler and quicker.
